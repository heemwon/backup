Considering the limitations of providing day and night in one mode and not disturbing the user while driving, the information required for Dark Mode is designed to be shown in priority order. To create a futuristic and luxurious feel, we used a delicate pattern on a dark background and glow effect with luminance contrast. The project was carried out with a focus on information delivery and as simply as possible to avoid the trend.",
